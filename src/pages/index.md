# World Format
## Overview

**World** is a human-editable text format for describing the complete state of a small system.

It is designed for:
- single-user or low-scale applications
- textarea-based editing
- direct conversion to a JavaScript object
- iterative human–AI workflows (AI generates, humans edit, AI re-reads)

World is not a database schema, not TOML, not YAML, and not INI —  
but it intentionally borrows familiar surface syntax from all three.

The primary design goal is:
> Edit the world itself, not CRUD forms.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Document Represents the World

A World document represents a snapshot of the entire state.

The system does not expose explicit Create / Update / Delete operations.  
State changes are expressed by producing a new version of the document,  
whether edited by a human or generated by a program.

---

## Syntax

### 2. Node Declaration

A node is declared using a single-bracket **absolute path**.

Example:

```
[task1]
```

- Brackets declare a node
- The path uniquely identifies its position in the hierarchy
- Paths are separated by `/`
- Paths are **absolute**, not relative

Example:

```
[projectA/task1/subtask1]
```

---

### 3. Attributes

Attributes are assigned using `=`.

Escaped example:

```
name = "Write report"
done = false
priority = 2
```

Rules:
- Left side is a key
- Right side is a value
- `=` always means assignment
- No implicit typing beyond basic primitives

Supported value types:
- string
- number
- boolean

---

### 4. Hierarchy

Hierarchy is expressed **only** through paths.

Escaped example:

```
[task1]
name = "Task 1"

[task1/sub1]
name = "Subtask 1"
done = false
```

Notes:
- Parent–child relationships are determined solely by the path
- Document order does not imply hierarchy

This maps naturally to a tree structure.

---

### 5. Arrays (Repetition Rule)

Arrays are created implicitly by repeating the same absolute path.

Escaped example:

```
[task]
name = "Task A"

[task]
name = "Task B"
```

This results in:

- A single node declaration → object
- Multiple declarations at the same path → array of objects

No special array syntax is required.

---

### 6. Hierarchy with Arrays

Hierarchy and arrays compose naturally when paths are explicit.

Escaped example:

```
[task]
name = "Task A"

[task/sub]
name = "Subtask 1"

[task/sub]
name = "Subtask 2"
```

Important:
- `[task/sub]` is an absolute path
- It does **not** inherit meaning from the most recently declared `[task]`
- If a parent path resolves to an array, it cannot be used as an intermediate node and is considered invalid

---

## Semantics

### 7. Interpretation Model

- The document is treated as a set of node declarations
- Each declaration defines a node at its absolute path
- Attributes apply only to the node declared by that path
- No implicit parent, previous-node, or document-order context is used
- Repeated declarations at the same path accumulate into arrays

---

### 8. JavaScript Object Mapping

The format is designed to map directly to a JavaScript object.

Conceptual example (non-executable):

```
{
  task: {
    name: "Task A",
    sub: [
      { name: "Subtask 1" },
      { name: "Subtask 2" }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Design Principles

### 9. Minimal Syntax

- No indentation-based meaning
- No colons for structure
- No implicit context
- No explicit CRUD operations
- No schema required at write time

---

### 10. Human-First Editing

- Works in a plain textarea
- Mobile-friendly
- Easy to scan
- Easy to diff

Errors are structural, not semantic.

---

## Non-Goals

World intentionally does NOT aim to provide:
- Database-level constraints
- Query language
- Referential integrity
- Type inference
- Partial updates

Those belong to other layers.

---

## Summary

World is a format for people who:
- dislike forms
- trust text
- want structure without ceremony
- prefer late decisions over early schemas

You do not edit records.  
You rewrite the world.
